# xml-to-ip-port
XML to text converter, use it to convert from tools like masscan XML output to host:port


The input file must be standard and valid XML, i only tested this on masscan but you can customize it, the input file name is "inputXML.xml"
It creates and appends output to a file called "outputFile.txt"
